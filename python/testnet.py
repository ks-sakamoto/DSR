#INSTRUCTIONS
#This file is an application that runs a simple DSR test
#It runs a number of simulation steps
#At every step a number of simulated DSR nodes are updated
#The CAN_TALK matrix defines which nodes can talk after a given time step
#Run using "python3 testnet.py > logs/log_file_name"

#==================================README=======================================
#
#This is a DSR protocol implementation using Python.
#
#It is the project for CITS4419 - Mobile and Wireless Computing
#at The University of Western Australia.
